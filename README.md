👋 Hi, I’m Patricia Fiol! 

Before a photographer, now a web developer and always creative.

👀 I’m currently focusing on learning more about frontend, but the more I get into the backend the more I like it.

💞️ I’m open to collaborate on with anybody. My aim is getting inspiration and also inspire others. 

Making ideas happen feels like the best challenge to me.
